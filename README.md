# Typescript Sandbox

> A short project aiming to sharpen my skills, using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) with [French gouv API](https://api.gouv.fr/documentation/api_data_gouv) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Launching the project

1. Use `npm i` or `yarn` to download node modules in the directory

2. Use `npm start` or `yarn start` to run the project (see [Scripts](#scripts) for other options)

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Built With

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
